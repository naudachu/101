# 101
Terminal golang app that helps me to calculate the score of each player in a card game named "101".
TUI made with bubbletea library with "hand-made" players list component.

Game rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau-Mau_(card_game)

Hint:
- Press Backspace at the players view to substract points. QQ for â™ Q and Q for any other queen.
- Press Enter to add points during the round. Finishing with q, qq, qqq, qqqq and qqqqq adds 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100..

### Launch:
`go build ./main.go`
`./main`
